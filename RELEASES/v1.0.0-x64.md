# Release v1.0.0-x64

This release packages the x64 build of Application Priority Changer and includes the following folders/files in the repository:

- `dist/Application-Priority-Changer-portable-x64.zip` (portable x64 build)
- `assets/` (icons / branding used for distribution)

Included in the `dist` archive (portable x64):
- application executable and supporting files for x64 deployment
- readme and privacy policy (if present)

Notes
- Priority changes are performed natively (no PowerShell window) via Win32 `OpenProcess` / `SetPriorityClass`.
- Elevation (run as Administrator) may be required to change priority of some system or protected processes.

How to publish on GitHub
1. A git tag `v1.0.0-x64` will be created and pushed to the `origin` remote.
2. To publish the assets on GitHub Releases, open the repository releases page and create a new release for the tag `v1.0.0-x64`, then upload `dist/Application-Priority-Changer-portable-x64.zip` as a release asset.

If you want me to also create the GitHub Release and upload the asset automatically, provide a GitHub personal access token (with repo permissions) or confirm that the `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated in this environment and I will create the release and upload the zip.
